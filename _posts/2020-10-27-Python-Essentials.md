Python is a widely-used, interpreted, object-oriented, and high-level programming language with dynamic semantics, used for general-purpose programming.

#### Why Python?
	
1. It is easy to learn - the time needed to learn Python is shorter than for many other languages; this means that it's possible to start the actual programming faster
2. It is easy to use for writing new software - it's often possible to write code faster when using Python;
3. It is easy to obtain, install and deploy - Python is free, open and multiplatform; not all languages can boast that.



#### Python goals

In 1999, Guido van Rossum defined his goals for Python:

1. an easy and intuitive language just as powerful as those of the major competitors;
2. open source, so anyone can contribute to its development;
3. code that is as understandable as plain English;
4. suitable for everyday tasks, allowing for short development times.


#### What is Python used for?

Most major webistes and services : Dropbox? UBER? Spotify? Pintrest? BuzzFeed?

1. Internet Applications (BitTorrent, Jogger Publishing Assistant, TheCircle, TwistedMatrix)
2. 3D CAD/CAM (FreeCAD, Fandango, Blender, Vintech RCAM)
3. Enterprise Applications (Odoo, Tryton, Picalo, LinOTP 2, RESTx)
4. Image Applications (Gnofract 4D, Gogh, imgSeek, MayaVi, VPython)
5. Mobile Applications (Aarlogic C05/3, AppBackup, Pyroute)
6. Office Applications (calibre, faces, Notalon, pyspread)
7. Personal Information Managers (BitPim, Narval, Prioritise, Task Coach, WikidPad) [Source: https://wiki.python.org/moin/PythonProjects]

Generally, Python is a great choice for:

1.	Web and Internet development (e.g., Django and Pyramid frameworks, Flask and Bottle micro-frameworks)
2.	Scientific and numeric computing (e.g., SciPy - a collection of packages for the purposes of mathematics, science, and engineering; Ipython - an interactive shell that features editing and recording of work sessions)
3.	Education (it's a brilliant language for teaching programming! And that's why we're offering this course to you!)
4.	Desktop GUIs (e.g., wxWidgets, Kivy, Qt)
5.	Software Development (build control, management, and testing - Scons, Buildbot, Apache Gump, Roundup, Trac)
6.	Business applications (ERP and e-commerce systems - Odoo, Tryton) [Source: https://www.python.org/about/apps]



#### Types of Python

1. Python 2 : older version of original python

2. Python 3 : current version of the language

There is more than one version of each python.

1. CPython : All pythons coming from the Python Software Foundation(PSF) are written in the "C" language. It is the default implementation of the Python Programming Language.

2. Cython : Another Python family member that is intended to do - to automatically translate the Python code into "C" code. This makes python efficient for tasks that needs large and complex mathematical calculations. However the resulting code's execution may be extremely time-consuming.

3. Jython : Implements Python 2 standards and can ommunicate with existing Java Infrastructure.

4. PyPy and RPython : PyPy - a Python within a Python. Restricted Python(RPython) is a subset of Python.
