<p> Is Zero(0) a number? Well,it is so well established in our number system today that, we don't even give a second thought to this question.
Just Imagine yourself at times before 0. What level of intelligence must have been necessary to establish something that doesn't exist in human mind? <br>
We are quite mesmerized by the illumination of the moon, the light of stars  and often, we ignore the larger existence  that includes the very source of light.The fact is, our visual apparatus is made in such a way that it cannot see the darkness that sits in the lap of the nothingness. For an instance, what is the first thing that comes into notice, when we look at the image below.
