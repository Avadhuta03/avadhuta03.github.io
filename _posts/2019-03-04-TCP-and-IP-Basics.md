TCP/IP is at the core of computer netwoking as we know today. TCP/IP standards are checked against certain criteria to maintain its integrity and ensure that any dramatic changes are not made and proprietary features are not added. This open apporach makes it most reliable and thus, popular.<br>

<p>
Open System Interconnection(OSI) Model was developed to logically address the characteristics and standarize the communication functions in telecommunication.
There are 4 logical layers [ Process/Application, Transport, Internet, Link ] in original DoD(Department of Defence) Model which is extended to 7 layers in OSI reference model. 


<table>
<tr><th>Layer</th><th>Logical Name</th><th>Protocols Implemented</th><th>Functions</th></tr>

<tr>
 <td>1</td>
 <td>Physical</td>
 <td>IrDA, DSL, USB, Ethernet physical layer...</td>
 <td>related to electrical and mechanical aspects of data transmission such as voltage levels and connector pin assignments.</td>
</tr>

<tr>
 <td>2</td>
 <td>Link/Data Link</td>
 <td>ARP,NDP, OSPF, L2TP, PPP, MAC,Ethernet, FDDI, ...</td>
 <td>oversees hardware addressing,defines protocols for the physical transmission of data</td>
 </tr>

 <tr>
 <td>3</td><td>Network</td>
 <td>IP, ICMP, ARP, RARP, ....</td>
 <td>handles addressing of hosts using IP address and  routing of packets among multiple networks</td>
 </tr>


 <tr>
 <td>4</td><td>Transport</td>
 <td>TCP, UDP, ....</td>
 <td>creating reliable end-to-end communication,<br> ensure error-free delivery of data,<br>maintains data integrity, handles packet sequencing</td>
 </tr>

<td>Session<br>

Application</td>
<td>Telnet, FTP, TFTP, SNMP,<br> DHCP, NTP, TSL/SSL, RIP, SSH<br>HTTP, SMTP, POP3...</td>
<td>node to node application communication, controls UI specifications</td>
