Blockchain are generally referred to as digital decentralized ledgers. Blocks are like the pages of notebook where transactions are recorded. 
<!--continue-->
In blockchain notebook, all the pages are linked together. So any attempt to try and change data on any page simply breaks the link which gives Blockchain Immutability.

Blockchains also provide us with technology called smart contracts, which allowsus to programmatically define rules and steps that should be performed any time a certain type of event is recorded in our blockchain.
<br>

<p>
<h4>Blocks</h4>
Blocks stores data like pages in notebook stores information.
Same block can hold any data like medical records, voting etc.
Each block is chained to the previious block by embedding the block with information from the previous block. 
Any tampering results into the break of link in obvious way.

<h4>Blockchain Components</h4>
<ol>
<li>Ledger: <br>collection of transactions. In blockchain, the ledger is a distributed immutable record of a collection of transactions.</li>
<li> Smart Contract: <br>permanent and immutable collection of code that runs on the blockchain. <br>
Users can interact with smart contracts in a similar way to the standard computer programs.</li>
<li> Peer network:<br>stores, updates and maintains the ledger. Each node in this network maintains its own copy of the ledger and the job of the network is to come to the consensus on the contents of each update to the ledger.
</li>
<li>Membership Services:<br> user authentication, authorization and identity management<br>
Anyone can join the peer network and all network members have equal powersa and authority. Permissioned blockchains require authorization to join.</li>
<li>Wallet:<br> collection of user credentials like private keys. It tracks information associated with their account.   </li>ss
<li>Events:<br> notifications of actions that are triggered when someone interacts with the chain</li>
<li>Systems Management:Component creation, modification and monitoring<br>
It provides the capability of creating, modifying, and monitoring blockchain components.</li>
<li>Systems Integration: Integration with external systems<br>
It is included to integrate blockchains with other external systems, usually through the use of smart contracts.</li>
</ol>


<h4>Blockchain Actors</h4>
<ol>
<li>Architect: the person or group who designs and implements the backend code of the Blockchain</li>
<li>Operator: Operators(nodes) create peer network. They store copies of the ledger and keep their copy up to date by distributing transactions and new blocks througout their network.</li>
<li>Developer: They design, write and upload smart contracts to the blockchain to expand its capablities.</li>
<li>Regulator: They have more visibility into the historical ledger due to their role within the orgainiztion.</li>
<li>End User: They interact with blockchain using software that uses the blockchain as a backend storage solutions.</li>
<li>Data Storage:<br>
	Blockchain provides distributed, immutable storage with built-in integrity checking; however, for large amounts of data, data is stored off-chain and a hash of the data is stored on-chain. This prevents bloating of blockchain<

</li>
<li>Data Processing:<br>
To execute smart contracts, large amount of processing power can be required. For this reason , devices external to the peer network may be used to augment the processing power of the network.</li>
</ol>
